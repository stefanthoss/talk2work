Project during the Launch Hackathon 2013, November 8 - 10

Description
-----------

TALK2WORK is a web-based carpool application for enterprise companies to help their employees save money and time, increase team building and decrease pollution. Employees within one company use the app to build carpool groups for commuting to work.
The app automatically retrieves information about all employee cars that are connected to the system and determines the best carpool groups according to the users' location, commute time and interests.
Users simply have to use the corporate login, choose a discussion topic and decide whether they want to join a co-worker's ride or provide their own car. Everything else is done by TALK2WORK.
