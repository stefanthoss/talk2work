Project during the Launch Hackathon 2013, November 8 - 10

Description
-----------

TALK2WORK is a web-based carpool application for enterprise companies to help their employees save time and money, increase team building and decrease environmental pollution. Employees from a company use the app to build carpool groups in order to commute to work.
The app automatically retrieves information from the cars of interested employees that are connected to the system and determines the best carpool groups according to the users' location, commute time and interests.
Users simply have to use the corporate login, choose a discussion topic and whether they want to join a ride or provide their own car. Everything else is done by TALK2WORK.
